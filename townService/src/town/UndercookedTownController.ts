 * The UndercookedTownController class's main responsibility is to connect a client's socket to the
 * Undercooked town. The implementation of this class will be similar to TownsController.ts in the townService
 * but tweaked since there is no need for multiple Undercooked 'towns'.
 *
 * The UndercookedTownController will be used in the Server.ts file when a client connects to the
 * '/undercooked' namespace.
