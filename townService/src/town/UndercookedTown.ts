/**
 * The UndercookedTown class implements the logic for an Undercooked game: managing the various
 * events that can occur (e.g. joining a game, leaving a game, moving around in the undercooked town, etc.)
 *
 * The implementation of this class will be similar to Town.ts in the townService directory but tweaked
 * for Undercooked game rules and mechanics.
